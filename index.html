            <p> I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they
                play in
                large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been
                supported by
                an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard
                Foundation
                Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty
                Fellowship, and
                grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of
                the National
                Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<br>

<h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In Spring 2022, <a href="https://www.karen-levy.net/"> <strong> Karen Levy</strong></a> and I are teaching
        Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340).
        The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical,
        societal, and policy implications of computing and information.

    <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge
        University Press, 2010.
        This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like the course,
        is
        designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper explorations,
        most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.
